# Contributing to Visual-Question-Answering-App

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the **Visual-Question-Answering-App** project!  
This repository focuses on building an AI application that answers questions based on image inputs — combining computer vision and natural language understanding. Your contributions — whether enhancements, new features, or documentation improvements — are highly valued!



## 🚀 How You Can Contribute

### 🧠 Feature Enhancements
- Add support for more robust image understanding (e.g., scene descriptions, object relations).  
- Improve handling of edge case questions (multiple objects, fine-grained details).  
- Add multi-lingual support for questions and answers.

### 📊 Model Improvements
- Try advanced multimodal models like CLIP, BLIP, OFA, ViLT, or Flamingo alternatives.  
- Improve evaluation metrics and add scripts for measuring performance (accuracy, BLEU, etc.).  
- Add model fine-tuning pipelines or parameter optimisation.

### 🛠 UI & Interactivity
- Enhance the frontend interface for users to upload images and ask questions.  
- Add real-time feedback or interactive highlighting of image regions.  
- Add mobile-friendly UI support.

### 📚 Documentation & Tutorials
- Improve the project README with step-by-step guides.
- Add example notebooks showing how to train, evaluate, or experiment with the model.
- Provide sample image inputs and expected outputs for clarity.

### 🧪 Testing & Reproducibility
- Add unit or integration tests for model components and data pipelines.  
- Ensure notebooks/scripts are reproducible and easy to run from scratch.
